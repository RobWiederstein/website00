# Website00

Test: Exclude `site_libs` and `index_cache` via `.gitignore` to see if site still generates on `gh-pages` branch.

Result: The site generated and was displayed at [https://robwiederstein.github.io/website00/](https://robwiederstein.github.io/website00/)

Lesson:  Exclusion of `site-libs`, `index_cache`, and `_site` from version control may eliminate the need for GitHub's large file service.
